# wv-ml-spectra
This repo was developed at WebValley 2016. It uses various machine learning techniques to analyze the spectra for grapes, basilica leaves, and raspberries.
Grapes:
* TSNE, MDS, GMM, and PCA techniques for dimensionality reduction and visualization of data.
* LDA, QDA, and SVM techniques for 2 classification problems: red vs green grapes; 3 types of green grapes.
* Script to pre-process spectra using website.
Raspberries:
* Similar code to that of the 3-class grapes was used.
* Script to pre-process spectra using website.
Basilica Leaves:
* Program to plot spectra.
* Program to analyze the chlorophyll and water potential of leaves.
* Script to pre-process spectra using website.
Full Algorithm:
* A final algorithm that searches through multiple techniques.
